  - Category:   Stack
  - Level:      02
  - Author:     Marcos Alvares <marcos.alvares at gmail>

- Format:

  Binary Format:      ELF, static
  Source Code:        C ANSI
  Operating System:   Linux
  Architecture:       Intel 32 bits
  Build:              Debug mode, without stack guard GCC optimization
                      without kernel stack randomization

- Objective:

  Find and exploit the stack buffer overflow bug. This code has a
  random function to fill the buffer. The attacker must know the
  C pseudo random function behavior to exploit this vulnerability.
