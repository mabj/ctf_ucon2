- Format:

  Binary Format:      ELF, static
  Source Code:        C ANSI
  Operating System:   Linux
  Architecture:       Intel 32 bits
  Build:              Debug mode, stack guard GCC optimization disabled,
                      stack-based addresses randomization disabled

- Objective:

  Find and exploit the stack based buffer overflow bug. In this challenge
  you can not control the %eip directly, instead, you need to override
  the %ebp in order to take control of the process' execution flow and
  manage to exploit the challenge.
