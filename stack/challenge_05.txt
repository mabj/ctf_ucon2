  - Category:   Stack
  - Level:      03
  - Author:     Marcos Alvares <marcos.alvares at gmail>

- Format:

  Binary Format:      ELF, static
  Source Code:        C ANSI
  Operating System:   Linux
  Architecture:       Intel 32 bits
  Build:              Debug mode, without stack guard GCC optimization
                      without kernel stack randomization

- Objective:

  Find and exploit the stack buffer overflow bug. This code has a
  stack check if the stack canaries was override the software will exit.
  This forces the attacker to insert a exact portion of data to
  override the return point. This code have a random (time based) number
  of canaries, this difficult a little more the attacker exploitation
  attempt.
