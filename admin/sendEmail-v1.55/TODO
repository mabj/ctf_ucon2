Feature Ideas
    [ ] A preferences file with default settings?
    [ ] Convert inline documentation to standard perldoc format?
    [ ] Deliver directly to MX server for domain?
    [ ] Support for pop before smtp?
    [ ] Preferences registry settings for the Windows .exe version?
        That way people could set a default character set and such.
    [ ] What about an option to send the same message more than once?
    [ ] How about a delay before sending the message?
    [ ] What about an internal queue for messages that wern't sent?
        Next time it's invoked it could deliver those messages as well.
